# Pre-Check
Did you have any problems if any getting the project set up?

# Problem A
What was the issue with the class?

(Optional) Why might someone find the person class funny?

# Problem B
Why is it difficult to test methods that use floating points?

# Problem C
How would you change the simulator so that the code is testable?

Based on our examples, it seems that Person A always gets the short end of the stick and has to drive more when going on a trip?
Is this true or false? If true explain your reasoning and estimate how much more Person A has to drive than B. If false explain 
why our examples are giving us this false impression and what to change for more equal trips.
